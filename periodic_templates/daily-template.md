weekly:: [[Weekly/<% moment(fileDate).format("YYYY-[W]WW") %>|Weekly Note]]

See the [README](README.md) and [weekly-note.md](weekly-note.md) for more info.

## Description 

I include a link to the weekly note for each day, not just for handy navigation, but to also leverage the inlinks shorthand from dataview. For things I did in a day that I want to be summarized in the weekly note, I specifiy it with a `d:: ` inline metadata field.

## Did

- d:: Added my periodic templates to github
